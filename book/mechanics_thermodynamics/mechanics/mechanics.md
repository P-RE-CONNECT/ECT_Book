# Mechanics

This part of the course mechanics and thermodynamics covers mechanics and continuum mechanics. Mechanics covers the study of objects that can be modeled as discrete particles, like a ball or a pulley. Continuum Mechanics on the other hand covers objects that are modeled as a solid body, like a pack of sand or a piece of rock. 

Put simply: In Mechanics we study the movement of objects and assume that these objects don't deform, while in Continuum Mechanics we assume that objects do deform.
